I'm a JavaScript programmer and I'm currently particpating in Code Fellow's Development Accelerator, focusing on Full Stack JavaScript. In the first half of the program we have focused on building Node and Backbone Apps, RESTful APIs, and MongoDB.

This is my personal blog regarding my experience in Code Fellow's Development Accelerator and programming in general.
