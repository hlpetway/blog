<p>It's the end of the first week and we've written working servers using Node and Express. I'm also working through Smashing Magazine's Smashing Node.js. I'm finding this book very helpful in explaining the inner workings of Node as well as putting all in perspective.</p>

<p>Now that I have written working servers, it feels like the easiest thing in the world. It's amazing what a little study and practice can do.</p>
