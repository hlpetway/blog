I've heard a lot about Ractive, and we finally covered Ractive.js today. I also found out that it was developed by theguardian.com to allow them to create interactive news applications. That is very cool.

I spent some time with ractivejs.org's tutorials and I found them very helpful. As far as templating libraries go, I don't find it too hard to wrap my head around. We incorporated Ractive into our Notes App and it was very snappy.

I also find it very powerful that we update just the part of a view that we want to change without re-rendering the whole view.
