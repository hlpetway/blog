<p>This week we've been working through Data Strcutures and Algorithms with JavaScript by O'Reilly. We've made quick work of Lists, Stacks, Queues and Linked Lists. Now we've moved on to Binary Search Trees.</p>

<p>The structures are confusing at first glance, but after reading threw a few times, I've realized that they are actually simple. And I've enjoyed working through the exercises.</p>

<p>And all the while, we've been practicing white boarding. So far it has been very challenging, but with practice organizing and writing code by hand can become a strength.</p>
