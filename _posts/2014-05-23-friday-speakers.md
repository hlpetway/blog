Today we had two presentations, the first was by Keira Phifer an User Experience Researcher. She took us through the role of UX Research in application and software development. She also explained how to run a basic user experience study. She also recommended that we sit in on a study if we ever get the chance. She explained that observing the studies will help us understand what users are looking for and how they behave.

The second presentaion was by Rich Sheridan of Menlo Innovations. He is the CEO of Menlo and has written Joy, Inc. His book describes his companies unqiue culture. His company's culture centers around perfecting the work group and making it easier for programmers to work together. They also have a dog and baby friendly office. Sounds like heaven.
