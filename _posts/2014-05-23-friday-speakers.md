<p>Today we had two presentations, the first was by Keira Phifer an User Experience Researcher. She took us through the role of UX Research in web app and software development. She also explained how to run a basic user experience study. She recommended that we sit in on a study if we ever get the chance. She believes that observing users while they interact with our apps and features will help us understand what users are looking for and how they behave.</p>

<p>The second presentaion was by Rich Sheridan of Menlo Innovations. He is the CEO of Menlo and wrote Joy, Inc. His book describes his companies unqiue culture. Menlo's culture centers around perfecting the work group and making it easier for programmers to work together. All programmers work in pairs and are language agnostic. They also have a dog and baby friendly office. Sounds like heaven.</p>
